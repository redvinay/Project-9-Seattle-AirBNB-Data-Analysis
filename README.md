# Seattle AirBNB Data Analysis

Udacity DSND Project on writing a Data Science Blog Post

## Overview

This is an Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project. The aim of the project is to demostrate knowlege of the CRISP-DM Process for Data Analysis and Data Mining, be able to follow the process and then communicate your findings effectively and clearly to an audience.

## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Repository

The repository contains the following folders and files:

The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis following the CRISP-DM process.

## Results

My Questions are as follows:
If I want to travel to Seattle, I would research and analyzing on the following questions.
1. What is the average price per day of the week in Seattle?
2. What is the monthly average price/night for the city?
3. What is the availabilty of neigborhoods in Seattle throughout the year 2016?
4. What are the top and bottom neigborhoods based on the average price?

A summary of the results of the analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebook or in this [blog](https://medium.com/@vinay.analytics14/seattle-airbnb-data-analysis-6e5dd3e930cc) on medium.

## licensing

Must give credit to Udacity courses for some of code ideas, and to kaggle/AirBnb for the data. The licensing for the AirBnB data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/home) on the Kaggle site. I would like to thank the amazing professors, teachers and mentors working with Udacity, who are supporting me on this journey of DSND.
